# Group Chore
 
## Project Summary
    A mobile application for keeping track of who does what chores around the house, and when.

## Problem Statement
    When living with multiple people it can be tough to determine responsibility for chores around 
the house. Things like trash, dishes and groceries are typically used by everyone, but everyone 
may not be contributing the same to upkeep for these utilities.

## Solution
    We propose an all-in-one mobile application for keeping track of who does what around the 
house, and when. A mobile application that is easily accessible at any time from your phone 
would be the ideal medium for this project.

## Project Source
    We wanted to build this application because as college students we have all had roommates at 
one point or another, and sometimes it is hard to keep track of all the chores that may 
need done around the house and if everyone has been doing their fair share of work.

## Project Objectives/Goals
- Create a group where others can join by the group code
- Join an existing group through the groupâ€™s code
- Create activities within a group (Empty kitchen trash, empty dishwasher, buy milk, etc.)
- Display the last completed date of the aforementioned activity
- Assign activities to different group members
- Display a list of who did an activity and when

    This project would have an impact on individuals who live in houses with many other people. 
Most people who have lived in these situations, such as college housing, can sympathize with 
the problem this project attempts to solve. It could lead to a reduced number of disputes 
between housemates and more.
