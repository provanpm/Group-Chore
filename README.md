# Group Chore
 
## Project Summary
A mobile application for keeping track of who does what chores around the house, and when.

## Problem Statement
When living with multiple people it can be tough to determine responsibility for chores around 
the house. Things like trash, dishes and groceries are typically used by everyone, but everyone 
may not be contributing the same to upkeep for these utilities.

## Solution
We propose an all-in-one mobile application for keeping track of who does what around the 
house, and when. A mobile application that is easily accessible at any time from your phone 
would be the ideal medium for this project.
